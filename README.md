# conditional-gan
Keras implementation of a unconditional generative adversarial network (GAN) and a conditional GAN trained from 80 epochs on the fashion MNIST dataset. The conditional GAN
takes in an additional class label as input, and outputs an image in the corresponding class.

Below are example images that the cGAN produced (none of these images were in the original dataset):
